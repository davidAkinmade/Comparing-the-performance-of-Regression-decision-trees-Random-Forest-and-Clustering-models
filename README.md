# Comparing-the-performance-of-Regression-decision-trees-Random-Forest-and-Clustering-models
A mini Data science project that shows and compares several machine learning models including: decision tree regressors, Bagging Regressors, Random Forest trees, and K-Means clustering

The first dataset used is a Carseats data set which pertains to Sales of Child Car Seats gotten from https://r-data.pmagunia.com/dataset/r-dataset-package-islr-carseats while the dataset used for demonstrating the K-Means model is a dataset on different species that was gotten from https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market
